This package contains classes used by a client to establish and use a client connection to Gnip.
<br/>
<br/>
The Gnip API supports two primary usage patterns -- publishing data into Gnip and
subscribing to receive data from Gnip.  Depending on the usage, a Gnip user may be one, the other,
or both.  Both API usages deal with streams of either activity or notification data.  A Publisher provides
a complete view of activity data flowing through it, and Filters are used to configure streams that
express interet in a particular subset of activity data flowing through the Publisher.
<br/>
<br/>
Data is published into a Gnip  {@link com.gnipcentral.client.resource.Publisher} in the form
of a set of {@link com.gnipcentral.client.resource.Activity activities} that
represent events that happened on the Publisher.  Events are Publisher specific and could be an article "digg"
on Digg, a tweet from Twitter, or a train arrival from BART.  A Publisher makes data available in the form
of a "notification" which is a notice that an event occurred that doesn't include the event's complete data.
<br/>
<br/>
A user interested in getting data from Gnip can access notifications directly from a Publisher or create a
{@link com.gnipcentral.client.resource.Filter} with a set of {@link com.gnipcentral.client.resource.Rule rules}
that match specific activity data that a subscriber is interested in.  Filters can be "polled" using HTTP GET or "pushed"
if a Filter has a {@link com.gnipcentral.client.resource.Filter#setPostUrl(String) post URL}.
<br/>
<br/>
Activities that flow through Gnip are stored in buckets which capture 60 seconds worth of activities.  Buckets
can be accessed at "current" or using a specific timestamp.  Note, the current bucket may be incomplete
since by definition current is actively capturing data until its minute has elapsed.
